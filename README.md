# Files Explanations and Where to Start

* Start by looking through [BasicConcepts](https://github.com/woonsupkim/DataScience_Summary/blob/main/0.%20Review/BasicConcepts.pdf) and [Overview](https://github.com/woonsupkim/DataScience_Summary/blob/main/0.%20Review/Overview.pdf). These should be reviews.
* If you feel comfortable with all the basic concepts then try solving some of the [Practice Problems](https://github.com/woonsupkim/DataScience_Summary/tree/main/3.%20PracticeProblems). Practical [Cheat Sheets](https://github.com/woonsupkim/DataScience_Summary/tree/main/4.%20CheatSheets) are available to assist you in understanding the concepts and help you with your programming.
* For a review in specific concepts, you can look through the list of [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/woonsupkim/DataScience_Summary/tree/main/2.%20Lecture). 
* For an in-dept explanation, you can look through the infamous [ISL textbook](https://github.com/woonsupkim/DataScience_Summary/tree/main/1.%20TextBook). You will also find a summary of the textbook in that same folder.
